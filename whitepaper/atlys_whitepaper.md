## Appendix

### A. Technical Diagrams

### B. Mathematical Proofs
B.1 Validator Selection and Reputation Scoring
The validator selection process uses a weighted probability function that considers both stake amount and reputation score.
Let $V$ be the set of all validators, where each validator $v_i$ has:

Stake amount: $s_i$
Reputation score: $r_i \in [0,100]$
Historical performance: $h_i \in [0,1]$

The selection weight $w_i$ for validator $v_i$ is calculated as:
$
w_i = \alpha \cdot \frac{s_i}{\sum_{j \in V} s_j} + \beta \cdot \frac{r_i}{100} + \gamma \cdot h_i
$
where:

$\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$ (weight coefficients)
$\alpha = 0.4$ (stake weight)
$\beta = 0.35$ (reputation weight)
$\gamma = 0.25$ (historical performance weight)

B.2 Consensus Probability
The probability of achieving consensus $P(C)$ with $n$ validators and a required threshold $t$ is:
$
P(C) = \sum_{k=t}^{n} \binom{n}{k} p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
$
where:

$p$ is the probability of an honest validator
$t = \lceil 2n/3 \rceil$ (threshold for consensus)

B.3 Transaction Fee Model
The cross-chain transaction fee $F$ is calculated as:
$
F = b + \delta \cdot g \cdot c + \epsilon \cdot d
$
where:

$b$ is the base fee
$g$ is the gas price
$c$ is the computational complexity
$d$ is the data size
$\delta$ is the computational cost coefficient
$\epsilon$ is the data cost coefficient

B.4 Security Threshold Analysis
For the network to remain secure, the following inequality must hold:
$
P(A) < \frac{1}{3}N
$
where:

$P(A)$ is the probability of a successful attack
$N$ is the total number of validators

The probability of a successful attack is:
$
P(A) = \prod_{i=1}^{k} (1 - \frac{r_i \cdot s_i}{\sum_{j \in V} s_j})
$
where $k$ is the minimum number of validators needed to compromise the network.
B.5 Reputation Score Updates
The reputation score update function for validator $v_i$ after transaction $t$ is:
$
r_i^{new} = \begin{cases}
\min(100, r_i^{old} + \alpha_s) & \text{if transaction succeeds} \
\max(0, r_i^{old} - \alpha_f) & \text{if transaction fails}
\end{cases}
$
where:

$\alpha_s$ is the success reward (typically 1)
$\alpha_f$ is the failure penalty (typically 5)

B.6 Cross-Chain State Verification
For a cross-chain state transition to be valid, the following must be satisfied:
$
H(S_{t+1}) = H(S_t || T_t || V_t)
$
where:

$H$ is the cryptographic hash function
$S_t$ is the state at time $t$
$T_t$ is the transaction at time $t$
$V_t$ is the validation proof
$||$ denotes concatenation

B.7 Economic Security Model
The minimum stake requirement $M$ for the network to be economically secure is:
$
M > \frac{V_t \cdot R}{\lambda \cdot P_{ATLYS}}
$
where:

$V_t$ is the total value secured by the network
$R$ is the required security ratio (typically 3)
$\lambda$ is the slashing coefficient
$P_{ATLYS}$ is the price of ATLYS token

B.8 Transaction Finality Probability
The probability of transaction finality $P(F)$ after $k$ confirmations is:
$
P(F) = 1 - \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor} \binom{k}{i} q^i(1-q)^{k-i}
$
where:

$q$ is the probability of a malicious block
$k$ is the number of confirmations

B.9 Network Latency Model
The expected transaction confirmation time $T_c$ is:
$
T_c = T_b + T_p + T_v + T_f
$
where:

$T_b$ is the base network latency
$T_p$ is the processing time
$T_v$ is the validation time
$T_f$ is the finalization time

Each component follows a probability distribution:
$
T_x \sim N(\mu_x, \sigma_x^2)
$
where $x$ represents each time component.
